This project is a single page website with the exception of the checkout page,adding of selected elements to cart and payment system.

## Technology used

- This website is mainly built on HTML,CSS and React js.

- Use of local API server was implemented by creation of a json file,that is db.json that contains all the data items to be rendered by the React App.

- The data from the json file is then fetched using the fetch keyword in JavaScript and converted to useable data before being rendered to the DOM.
  While fetching the data a GET request is performed on the local API and a response is delivered hence data from our json file is successfully renered in the DOM.
